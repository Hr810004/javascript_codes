## Introduction
JavaScript is a powerful and versatile programming language used to create dynamic web applications. Mastering JavaScript starts with a solid understanding of its foundations and core concepts. This repository contains explanations, examples, and exercises to help you build a strong JavaScript foundation.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-foundations.git
cd javascript-foundations
```

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run JavaScript code locally. You can verify installation with:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
